Stat 504 HW#1Read Chapters 1 to 13 of Think Python - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, available at  http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/  well enough to do the following.Exercise 1  Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips whitespace and punctuation from the words, and converts them to lowercase. Exercise 2   Go to Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org) and download The King James Bible available at http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt in plain text format. Modify your program from the previous exercise to read The King James Bible you downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning of the file, and process the rest of the words as before.Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the Old Testament, and print out the number of times each word is used alongside the word if the word is used more than k times (where k as a user input parameter) in decreasing order. Print out the output when k=100.Repeat the above for the New Testament. Exercise 3  Modify the previous program to read a word list (see Section 9.1) and then print all the words in the Old Testament that are not in the word list, where this word list is user-input.Try the word list which includes all prepositions, pronouns, article, and conjunctions on Exercise 2. Print out the output with all other interesting words like nouns, proper nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives which occur more than 100 times in the Old Testament.Repeat the above for the New Testament.You can build your own programs from the author’s Python script on a similar project at http://thinkpython.com/code/analyze_book.py.http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Popular-Bible-Words.php has the King James Bible words count for your reference.
